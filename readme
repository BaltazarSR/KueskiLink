# KueskiLink

KueskiLink is a simple web app built for independent workers like gardeners, carpenters, and plumbers to manage their sales and get paid easily.

## 💡 What It Does

With KueskiLink, contractors can:

- Sign in and track the products or services they sell
- Create a payment link with the details of each transaction
- Share that link with their client
- Let the client pay directly from their phone — super fast and easy!

Everything runs from a webpage, so no need to install anything.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Built in collaboration with **KueskiPay**
- Uses **Supabase** as the database to store users and transactions
- Hosted on **Vercel** so it's live and easy to access
- Payments are handled with secure API keys provided by Kueski

## 🌐 Technologies

- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Vite
- Backend: Small set of API endpoints for handling payments and data
- Database: Supabase
- Hosting: Vercel

## 🚀 Try It Out

You just need a browser. Log in, add your products, generate a payment link, and send it to your client. That’s it!
